    <h1>Why GU = Friendship Goals ðŸŽ¯</h1>
    <p>Gandhinagar University isn't called the "Campus of Friendships" for nothing! Here's what makes our community special:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ðŸŽ¸ Spontaneous jam sessions under the banyan tree (guitar skills optional!)</li>
      <li>â˜• Midnight chai & maggi at the canteen - where deep conversations happen</li>
      <li>ðŸ“š Study groups that turn into lifelong friendships (and actually help you pass exams)</li>
      <li>ðŸ’¬ Shared stories from seniors about meeting their best friends during orientation week</li>
      <li>âœ¨ That magical GU feeling - where strangers become family in one semester</li>
    </ul>
