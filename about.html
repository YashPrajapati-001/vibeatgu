    <h1>More Than a University – A Home 🏠</h1>
    <p>
      At Gandhinagar University, our 50-acre campus buzzes with energy from sunrise yoga sessions to midnight study groups. What makes us special?<br/><br/>
      <b>Our secret sauce:</b> GU has been ranked #1 for student satisfaction 3 years running because we're more than classrooms – we're a <i>campus of connections</i> where every corner has a story.
    </p>

    <blockquote>“I visited 8 universities – GU had this <i>energy</i> I couldn't find anywhere else. Three years later, I'm graduating with 5 best friends and memories for life.”<br>- Kavita, Business '22</blockquote>
